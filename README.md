# Classification-of-Shapes-using-CNN
Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/cactus3/basicshapes
The neural network was trained with the dataset to classify circles, squares and triangles (dark outlines on white background)
The dataset has to be in a folder called "data" in the program directory. Inside the data folder 3 separate folders - train, test and validate
The train and validate folders contain the same 300 images in 3 folders - circles, squares and triangles. This separation of folders translates to the program reading 3 classes.
The test dataset contains random images from google images I downloaded to test the model. I don't own the rights to any of the images. They were used for educational purposes only.
