# Classification of Shapes using CNN 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to train a neural network to identify hand drawn images of squares, triangles and circles

### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/cactus3/basicshapes

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Regression Analysis

### Technologies
* Python
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
* Neural Networks

## Project Description
In this project, I worked on a dataset from kaggle consisting of hand drawn images of squares, triangles and circles. I trained a convolutional neural network on this and tried to classifiy some random test images. The test images were shapes downloaded from google.
